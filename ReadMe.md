Some people have complained that the date of the next aacppug meeting can be somewhat difficult to figure out.

Well as so many other things in computing, it's easy once you have a program to figure it out for you.

The date is chosen in order to facilitate the use of [OSAA](http://osaa.dk)'s rooms as a backup for our meetings; our meetings are placed on the wedensday of the week after the board meeting. Since the board meeting is always on the tuesday following tech talk tuesday (which is the first tuesday of each month), the aacppug meeting will regularly be planned on the wedensday following the third tuesday in each mont.

This very simple rule is what is expressed in this small program.

It is implemented using Howard Hinnants date library, which he presented at CPPCON 2015 and has made available here on github.

The license of this program extends of course only as far as my own code, the code written by Howard is his and is distributed under his license.
